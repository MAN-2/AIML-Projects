# Resume Scanner  â€” NLP-Based Semantic Matching

This smarter version of the resume scanner uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract resume content from PDFs and match it against a job description with expanded keyword recognitionâ€”including synonyms and related terms.

Instead of strict keyword comparison, it evaluates semantic relevance using spaCy and WordNet.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Recruiters look for resumes that match job requirementsâ€”but candidates may use different wording to describe the same skill. This scanner expands job keywords using synonyms from WordNet, processes resumes with spaCy, and calculates a match score that reflects deeper relevance.
