# AI & ML Mini Projects 

This repository is a curated collection of machine learning and AI mini projects developed using Python and industry-standard libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and NLTK. The goal is to demonstrate my applied understanding of ML concepts through clean, modular, and practical code examples.

Each project focuses on a specific ML or NLP concept, and collectively, they showcase my ability to work across classification, regression, computer vision, NLP, and recommender systems.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, spaCy
- **Platforms**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## üí° Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created to:
- Reinforce machine learning concepts through implementation
- Build a personal ML portfolio with working code examples
- Serve as a reference for future deep-dive projects

While many of these ideas were inspired by online tutorials and structured learning platforms (e.g., Udemy), all code has been written, organized, and commented by me to ensure conceptual clarity and customization.
